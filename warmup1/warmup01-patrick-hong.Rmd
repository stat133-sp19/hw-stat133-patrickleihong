###Plush Coconut Cake

![Picture of Plush Coconut Cake](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7907/46776031942_a6fdd65918_k.jpg)

**List of ingredients**

* 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (285 grams) all-purpose flour  
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt  
* 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar  
* 1/2 cup (110 grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy  
* 1 1/2 cups full- or low-fat coconut milk   
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) plain vinegar  

**List of special kitchen tools**

* 9-inch round cake pan  
* Parchment paper  
* Large mixing bowl  
* Whisk  
* Cooling Rack

**Steps of the recipe**

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  
2. Line the bottom of 9-inch round cake pan with a fitted round of parchment paper and coat the bottoms and sides with nonstick cooking spray.  
3. Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar in the bottom of a large mixing bowl.  
4. Add coconut oil, coconut milk, and vinegar and whisk until batter is smooth.   
5. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is springy and a tester inserted in the center comes out batter-free.
6. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then cut around it with a knife to ensure it is loosened and flip it out onto a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way.

**Did not specify specific season.**

**Variations of the recipe**

* For people who don't like the taste of coconut, can use a flavorless oil or vegan butter instead of coconut oil and then soy, almond, or oat milk instead of canned coconut milk to give a more neutral launchpad for other flavor combinations.  
* Make a glaze using 3/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons of leftover coconut milk, adding a little at a time, until it is smooth and not too runny.  
* Can add toasted coconut chips instead of white confetti sprinkles.

###Euclidean Distance


####Definition
___
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates if **p** = ($p_1$, $p_2$,..., $p_n$) and **q** = ($q_1$, $q_2$,..., $q_n$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d$(**p**,**q**) = $d$(**q**,**p**) = $\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \dots + (q_n-p_n)^2 )} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean Norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\| \textbf{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\dots+p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \cdot \textbf{p}}$,

where the last expression invloves the dot product.
