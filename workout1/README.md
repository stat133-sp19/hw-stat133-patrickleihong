This project is aiming to analyze the individual shots taken by players on the Golden State Warriors. 
The first part of the project is to create a file structure: Main directory is workout1 with subdirectories code, data, images, output, report.
Then download the data for each individual player and create a data dictionary which summarizes every variable.
Next, create a .R script file that takes the data from each individual player, manipulate columns and add a few columns, then bind all the data from each individual player into one dataframe with all the players information.
After that, using R script, create a graph for each shot each player took using x and y coordinates and then map that data onto an image with a basketball court in the background. Then using faceting, combine all the graphs into one single graph and convert the graph into a png image.
Create 3 tables using the shots-data.csv file that compares effective shooting percentage then using all the data found in this project write a narrative describing the warriors for the 2016-2017 NBA season.
